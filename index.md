## Overview

Study UHp is a web application that allows students to organize face-to-face groups for studying course material. It uses various technologies such as: 

* [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) for Javascript-based implementation of client and server code.
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) for component-based UI implementation and routing.
* [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) CSS Framework for UI design.
* [Uniforms](https://uniforms.tools/) for React and Semantic UI-based form design and display.

In order to minimize the possibility of cheating and taking advantage of the monetary incentives, grasshoppers will be required to submit proof of the help that they received (by providing screenshots or assignments). The submission will be sent to moderators to avoid cheating amongst classes. If the moderator decides that the submission was acceptable he/she will approve scoring and give the ‘sensei’ the number of rated points out of 5.

## Mockup Ideas

These are the ideas that we would like to implement in our web application.

### Landing Page

This is the first page that new or returning users see. Users can sign in or sign up.

After signing in and clicking the top left icon, users will see this landing page.

### User profile page

The page a user will see when they view (and can edit) their own personal profile.

### Friends

We would like to implement some kind of a "friends list" using the way Discord displays friends as a starting point.

### Other pages that currently do not have mockups:

#### User sign up page

The page when a user new to application needs to sign up.

#### User home page

The first page a user sees after logging in or returning.

#### Admin home page

A dashboard for administrative tasks.

#### Calendar page

The calendar page will list all upcoming study sessions and the list of those who are attending.

#### Create study session page

Allows a user to create a study session either "Right Now!" or scheduled in the future.

#### Find study sessions page

Users can search for current and future study sessions by class.

#### List study sessions page

Users can list all current and future sessions by class.

#### Leaderboard

Still a WIP, but our "game mechanic" will have some type of ranking system to displays top users.

#### Messages

Either a private or public message system that will allow users to asks questions and post messages regarding study sessions.
